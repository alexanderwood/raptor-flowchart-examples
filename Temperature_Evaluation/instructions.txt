Create a flowchart which asks the user for the temperature.
If the temperature is greater than or equal to 85, print "It's hot!"
If the temperature is less than 85 but greater than or equal to 60, print "It's very nice out."
If the temperature is below 60 but above or equal to 50, print "It's chilly, wear a light jacket."
Otherwise, print "It's cold."
Use nested decision structures to model this flowchart.
